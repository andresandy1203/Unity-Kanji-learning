    dot of the dirt flying off because of the motion), the '\u5468' radical means
    circumference (the moustache that we saw on \u5186 , but instead of surrounding
    teeth, now its around dirt(\u571F) above a mouth(\u53E3) )  \"Each week the Earth
    moves around the circumference of the sun!!\" "
