  _mnemonic: "The kanji is composed by using the radical 'ten' \u5341 below the radical
    'one' \u4E00, ten looks like a cross, and the one like a tilted hat; it may be
    easy to remember by thinking, a CROSS wearing ONE THOUSAND tilted hats\""

  _lookalikes: "\u5E72 dry out; 'thousand' and 'dry out' look the same . ..except
    the top of thousand is tilted. 'I wear one thousand TILTY hats,  but I got to
    dry them out on a surface that is FLAT. '"
